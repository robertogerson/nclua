Description:  This is the NCLua library, libnclua.  The NCLua library adds
 event handling and 2D graphics to Lua scripts.  Programs written in C can
 use libnclua to run embedded NCLua scripts, i.e., Lua scripts that use the
 APIs exported by libnclua; Lua scripts can also use libnclua, either
 through the C API or by requiring the appropriated modules -- e.g.,
 'canvas' for 2D graphics, 'event' for general event handling,
 'event.stopwatch' for stopwatch timers, 'event.socket' for asynchronous
 sockets, etc.  The NCLua library comes with a standalone interpreter,
 called nclua (cf. src/nclua.c), which can be used to run NCLua scripts.
